## WarGame

Each side is dealt a deck of 26 sorted cards. Both participants draw and reveal a card; the one with the higher value wins the round, then placing both the opponent's card and their own at the bottom of their deck.

In the event of a tie, a "War" is declared. Here, both players draw three cards face-down, followed by a fourth card face-up. The participant with the higher fourth card wins, taking all ten cards (5 from the opponent and 5 of their own) and placing them at the bottom of their deck.

The game continues until one player has all the cards or if one player reaches 50 points. A player who does not have enough cards left to complete a war round will lose.
