# CardGames
## Todo
* [x] Make UML class diagram, and sequence diagram  
* Must be changed with project, and preferably before code
* [x] Make a card class for playing cards
* Make enum values for said class
* [x] Generate deck for cards
* [x] Implement games
    1. [x] War
    2. [x] Blackjack?
* [x] Make a working UI for the different games
* [x] Have a working version of the code
* [x] Use design patterns (extend and clean this up a bit later)
## Guidelines
* [x] Layering?
* Higher layers should know lowers, but not the other way around

Feel free to add more to this :)
